To begin, click on the Lemonade stand icon on your XO.

After the program has loaded, you will be presented with a prompt asking how many in-game days you would like to play.  The number in the brackets is the default value that will be used if you do not provide an answer.

You will then be presented with your starting resources.  For each game day, you will be asked how many raw materials you would like to purchase for that day.  You need one of each item to make lemonade.  Thus, if you expect to sell at least 5 lemonade for that day, you should amke sure you have at least 5 of each item.  Once you have decided what to buy, the day passes and you are told how much you made for that day.  Sales depend on the weather, so be sure to notice the forecast for the next day!

Occasionally, random events will occur giving you extra resources or removing more resources than normal.  Try it out and see how much you can make!
